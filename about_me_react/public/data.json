			"description": "Created in Fall 2022 during a Data Visualization course, this project employs Tableau, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to illuminate the trends in college tuition and its impact on income. It offers interactive visualizations that reveal changes in tuition costs over time, differences in regional education expenses, and the economic benefits of a college degree. This concise yet comprehensive analysis serves as a valuable resource for students, educators, and policymakers, highlighting the significant role of higher education in shaping financial futures."

			"image": "/img/Dominos.png",
			"description": "Written as a final project for the course Financial Forecasting in Fall 2023, this paper explores the relationship between Domino's Pizza's revenue and its various financial and non-financial factors. The paper also compares the performance of different models in predicting revenue, such as between Multiple Regression, ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, etc. The models are iteratively developed using SPSS by IBM. A python automation script (availible in my GitHub Page) was developed to automate the process in developing the best ARIMA model."

			"description": "One morning, I discovered that every email in my Gmail was mistakenly marked as important with a starâ€”a real mess for someone who likes to keep things tidy. Unstarring them one by one wasn't practical, so I took matters into my own hands. I wrote a simple computer program that quickly unstarred all my emails, bringing order back to my inbox with just one click. It was a quick, smart fix that saved me time and a lot of frustration."

			"title": "Google Drive Automation",
			"category": "Automation",
			"image": "/img/project-google_drive.png",
			"description": "In the midst of my role as a Teaching Assistant for a Data Visualization course, I encountered a daunting challenge: the laborious task of manually organizing and uploading student reviews to individual Google Drive folders. Each student reviewed three peers, multiplying the workload and complexity. Motivated to find a more efficient solution, I turned to Python, my trusted ally in coding. Crafting a script with a blend of ingenuity and technical prowess, I created a system that automatically sorted these reviews by student names, deftly created dedicated folders on Google Drive, and seamlessly uploaded the files. This not only transformed a tedious process into a swift, automated one but also stood as a testament to the practical power of programming in solving real-world problems. It was a journey that melded my skills in coding with a drive to enhance academic processes, making a significant impact on the course's administrative efficiency."
